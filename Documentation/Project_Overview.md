🚀 ## How to Run the Project
1.	Load the dataset into your SQL environment.
2.	Create tables (layoffs_staging, layoffs_staging2) as per the provided SQL scripts.
3.	Run Data Cleaning scripts first, then Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) queries.
4.	(Optional) Visualize findings in a BI tool like Power BI or Tableau.
